[哈佛 CS109 课程习题](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cs109/2014/blob/master/homework/HW1.ipynb)

In this homework we ask you three questions that we expect you to answer using data. For each question we ask you to complete a series of tasks that should help guide you through the data analysis. Complete these tasks and then write a short (100 words or less) answer to the question.

## Problem 1
we showed a plot that provided evidence that the 2002 and 2003 Oakland A's, a team that used data science, had a competitive advantage. Since, others teams have started using data science as well. Use exploratory data analysis to determine if the competitive advantage has since disappeared.
## Problem 2
Several media reports have demonstrated the income inequality has increased in the US during this last decade. Here we will look at global data. Use exploratory data analysis to determine if the gap between Africa/Latin America/Asia and Europe/NorthAmerica has increased, decreased or stayed the same during the last two decades.
